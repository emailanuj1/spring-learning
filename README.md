Welcome to the Streamlinity Coding Test.

Please read the problem statement for the requirements.

### Code you need to write:

1. You need to fill out the starter code in the
   com.streamlinity.ct.*.challenge package
   
   Please read through the comments carefully and follow instructions re
   not break the Spring wiring for testing.
   
2.  Your code needs to pass ALL the Junit test cases in the test/java
    directory. You can open any of these tests to see what they do or
    run them from the debugger or from the mvn command line.
    
3.  Please read the companion README-*.md for more instructions specific
    to the requirements.
    
    
### Some tips to make your Coding Test successful

1. Please watch the clock. This is a timed test. We do not allow time
   extensions or redos.
   
2.  We strongly recommend using the Local IDE approach. Commit your
    changes and push code to the remote repo periodically.
    
3.  Work incrementally, get pieces working in order in Requirements doc
    and commit/push incremental functionality, so that you get partial
    credit if you do not complete the whole assignment.
    
### Other information items

1. The tests are written in Junit4 and use JunitParams to avoid issues
   with older IDEs. We have verified that this works on recent versions
   of IntelliJ and Eclipse. This is mostly FYI only. You should not be
   editing these tests in any case. The Maven pom files already have all
   the required dependencies specified correctly (you should not be
   editing the POM files as well).
   
   In the unlikely event that you are unable to run the tests in the
   debugger, you still have the option of running the tests via "mvn
   clean test" from your terminal.
